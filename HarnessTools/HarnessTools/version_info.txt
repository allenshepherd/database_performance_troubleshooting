Hotsos Test Harness v 4.0.0
valid as of 18 April 2011

v4.0.0
--------------------------------------------
Main changes from the v3 scripts were to the harness 
start, stop and chk scripts.  These scripts were modified to use 
DBMS_SCHEDULER instead of DBMS_JOBS. The older version of theses 
scripts have the _OLD suffix in the file name. 
All scripts dealing with INDEX information were modified to show 
invisible indexes.
Minor changes to other scripts were made so they work under v11
of Oracle.  No attempt was made to keep backward compatibility.
The intent was to make v4 of the harness for v11 of Oracle.
The HLIO scripts and associated files were not updated.
