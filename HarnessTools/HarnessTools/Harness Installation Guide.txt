Hotsos Test Harness

This version (V4) of the test harness works on Oracle database version 11. It may or may not
work in older versions. 

Critical usage note:
In SQL*Plus version 9.0.x, the REPLACE option of the SPOOL command is *not* valid.
You must either update all harness files to remove the REPLACE option or upgrade your
version of SQL*Plus to a later release (9.1 or above).


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Download the harness .zip file from the Hotsos portal and unzip into a local directory
on your computer (e.g. C:\Harness).

Create an environment variable named SQLPATH and set it to the harness directory:
    SQLPATH = C:\Harness

Log in as SYS or a SYSDBA-privileged account on the instance on which you wish to install the harness.
        SQL> conn sys/sys as sysdba

Note:
If you are NOT logging on as SYS, the account you use must have explicit privileges granted to
certain objects.  Please see the harness_dba_privs.sql for the grants required.

Open the script file named harness_sys_install.sql and read the header information.
Search through the script and locate any section marked with '****** CHANGE ME ******' and
make modifications as needed to match your environment.

Verify that the support packages are loaded:
   1) dbms_support (v9)
   2) dbms_pipe
   3) dbms_monitor (v10)
   4) dbms_lock
   5) dbms_space

Execute harness_sys_install.sql.
        SQL> @harness_sys_install

For each user that will be using the Hotsos Test Harness, the DBA must execute the
harness_grant_privs.sql script:
        SQL> @harness_grant_privs username

Note that any error messages that indicate tables not found or packages not found (dbms_monitor
won't be found in v9 databases for example) are expected and are not problematic to the installation.
Just ignore them.


------------- End of SYS installation ----------------


Each person who wishes to use the Hotsos Test Harness will need to create the
harness-related objects in their schema.

Log in to the schema/account that will be using the Hotsos Test Harness.
        SQL> @hconnect op/op@hotsos

NOTE:  If this connection fails, open hlogonoff.sql and edit it to comment
       out the first connect string and uncomment the second connect string as
       follows:

        rem @hconnect &hotsos_testharness_user/&hotsos_testharness_passwd@&hotsos_testharness_instance

        @hconnect &hotsos_testharness_user/&hotsos_testharness_passwd

        Save the file and try to execute @hconnect again, and this time
        it should work.

Execute harness_user_install.sql
        SQL> @harness_user_install

Respond to the prompts as appropriate based on your computer's operating system.


------------- End of Harness User installation ----------------


You are now ready to use the Hotsos Test Harness!


------------- Verifying the Harness Installation ---------------
It is advisable that you complete a simple test to verify the harness installation.

Open the file named 'Harness User Guide.txt' and follow the steps to start the harness and execute the do.sql script.

Any simple SQL statement will suffice to use for testing the functionality of the harness.  If you don't 
have the old stand-by emp table created in your schema, simply use a query such as 
SELECT 'hello world' from dual ; instead.

If any portion of the initial test of do.sql fails, you have two options to debug the error.  First, you can 
open up the do.sql script file and locate at approximately line 22, the command " define debug = 'OFF' ".  Change 
the entry from OFF to ON and save the file.  Then re-execute your test and look through the output for error 
messages.  Just remember to reset the value back to OFF after you have found and fixed the problem.  If the 
first method doesn't help you locate the error, then there is a second option.  There is a script named 
harness_test_load.sql that can be used to manually verify installation step-by-step.  Simply open the 
harness_test_load.sql file and manually execute each step one at a time.  If errors exist, this script will show 
you exactly where the error is and you can address those errors specifically.  If you have any questions about 
any error that doesn't seem obvious how to resolve can be submitted to our Hotsos Support Discussion 
forum at http://support.hotsos.com/default.asp?hotsos.  Simply post a message showing the error and provide a 
brief explanation of your installation.  You can also search the forum for similar posts that may already 
contain the answer to your question.  We find that there are typically only 2-3 common errors that occur and they 
are easily resolved.
